     - Currently, this file's only "real" public method is
       ~play_full_game~. It used to have more public API but nothing
       else is called externally now. The methods are still marked as
       public, but they're really kinda not.
   + [X] ~card_game/playing_field/game_stats_panel/game_stats_panel.gd~ and ~.tscn~
     - setget syntax

     - tree-sitter chokes +and we can't parse ~match~ clauses right
       now.+
   + [X] ~card_game/playing_field/util/stats.gd~
     - Same logic as CardGameAPI

     - [X] ~card_game/playing_card/playing_card/playing_card_display/card_icon/card_icon.gd~

     - [X] ~card_game/playing_field/util/popup_text.gd~
   + [X] Promise.gd
     - Needs to exist but hopefully will not ever be /actually/ used.
